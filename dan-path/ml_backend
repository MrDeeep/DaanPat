🧠 ML Backend

The ML Backend is responsible for handling all machine learning–driven features of our platform. It is built in Python and designed as a modular service so multiple AI models can run in parallel and provide predictions that support the platform’s core functionality.

🔍 Current Capabilities

Content Moderation (NudeNet)

Uses the pre-trained NudeNet model to automatically classify user-uploaded images as SAFE or UNSAFE.

Supports detection of specific NSFW regions in images.

Can be extended to blur/censor unsafe regions before displaying them on the frontend.

Ensures that all content shared within the platform is safe and community-friendly.

🌍 Disaster Prediction (Custom Model – upcoming)

Disaster Probability Estimation

Predicts the probability of a disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake, cyclone) occurring in a given region based on input data.

Outputs a confidence score (e.g., “There is a 72% chance of flood risk in this district”).

Impact Estimation

Estimates the approximate number of people that may be affected in the predicted disaster zone.

Uses population density, geographic features, and disaster intensity as key input parameters.

🔗 Integration

The backend will expose APIs (via Flask/FastAPI) that can be consumed by the Next.js frontend.

For example:

POST /moderate → Returns whether an uploaded image is safe or unsafe.

POST /predict-disaster → Returns disaster probability and estimated population impact.

🎯 Goal

The ML Backend ensures a safe environment for users while also acting as a smart prediction system that can provide early warnings for potential disasters, improving preparedness and resilience.
